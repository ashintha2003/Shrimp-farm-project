# Shrimp-farm-project

We made a boat that can be driven in a shrimp farm, and the user can control the boat. Underneath the boat, there are 6 sensors: turbidity, ph, salinity, dissolved oxygen, humidity, and temperature. All these sensors' readings are sent to the cloud, and the data is observed in real time. I also used LoRa network for the communication since the boat has a range of 100 m. the IOT platform will record the details in real time, and it will display which values are stable and unstable. 

## Components
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32  
- **Development Environment (IDE)**: Arduino IDE
